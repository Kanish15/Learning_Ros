# Learning ROS 

This repository contains code and resources for learning ROS Noetic and implementing nodes using Python for navigation tasks in Turtlesim, including both open-loop and closed-loop feedback navigation.

## Overview

ROS (Robot Operating System) is a widely-used framework for building robotics software. ROS Noetic is one of the major releases of ROS, offering support for various platforms and architectures.

In this repository, you'll find:

- Python scripts for implementing ROS nodes
- Launch files for launching multiple nodes and configuring the ROS environment
- Documentation and tutorials to guide you through the learning process

## Learning Goals

The main objectives of this repository include:

1. **Understanding ROS Noetic**: Learn the basics of ROS Noetic, including concepts such as nodes, topics, messages, services, and more.
2. **Implementing Nodes with Python**: Gain proficiency in writing ROS nodes using Python, which is a popular language choice for ROS development.
3. **Turtlesim Navigation**: Explore the Turtlesim environment provided by ROS and implement navigation tasks, including both open-loop and closed-loop feedback navigation strategies.
